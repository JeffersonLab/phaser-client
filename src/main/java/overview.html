        <h1>Phaser Client</h1>
        <p>The Phaser Swing Client is an application for Operators at JLab to control the Phaser server.</p>
        <div>
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>
                The Phaser Swing Client is distributed as an executable jar file.
                It was developed as a certified product and Linux binaries can be found in the /cs/certified/apps/phaser file system path.
                The Phaser Swing Client requires Java 7 or greater and can be launched on Linux with the following command:
            </p>
            <pre><kbd>
./phaser-swing-client.sh                
            </kbd></pre>  
            Or to have debugging logged to the console:
            <pre><kbd>
./debug-phaser-swing-client.sh                
            </kbd></pre>
            Or to invoke Java manually (without the bash shell's Java version check):
            <pre><kbd>
java -jar phaser-swing-client.jar                
            </kbd></pre>
            <p>
                The versioning is organized into "major.minor" where major 
                versions indicate API changes and minor versions are for bug 
                fixes and implementation changes.
            </p>

            <h2>Configuration</h2>
            <p>
                A Java properties file named client.properties is located in the config directory.
                Users can set the host and port of the Phaser server here.  The URL to documentation is also specified here.
            </p>      
            <h2>Source Code</h2>
            <p>The Java Phaser Swing Client application is named <em>phaser-swing-client</em> 
                and is stored in the git repository on devl00.  It can be
                accessed by members of the JLab accelerator group <em>epics</em> 
                from an accelerator Linux machine with the command:</p>
            <pre><kbd>
git clone ssh://devl00/usr/devsite/git/phaser-swing-client.git 
            </kbd></pre>
            <p>
                An Apache Ant build file (build.xml) is used to compile and
                package the application.
            </p>   
        </div>
